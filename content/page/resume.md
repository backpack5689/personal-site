Hi future employer (or nosey individual)! My name is Aaron, and I live in the Nashville Area. Although I am an information security major, I wear a multitude of other hats! Outside of work, I enjoy camping, cooking, playing videogames, or working with OpenSource software. In my home, I really enjoy putting work into deploying different servers, as it is both fun, and a easy way to ensure that I can better server you, my boss (or any other individual).

If you are interested in chatting, please feel free to book some time on my calendar through [this link](https://www.calendar.com/aarons-workspace/)!
