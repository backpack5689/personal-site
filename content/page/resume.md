Hi future employer (or nosey individual)! My name is Aaron, and I live in the Nashville Area. Although I am an information security major, I wear a multitude of other hats! Outside of work, I enjoy camping, cooking, playing videogames, or working with OpenSource software. In my home, I really enjoy putting work into deploying different servers, as it is both fun, and a easy way to ensure that I can better server you, my boss (or any other individual).

If you would like to reach out about a potential job offer, please ensure to put `JOB: {remainder of subject}` to ensure that I read it in a timely manner. Otherwise, I cannot guarantee a timely response!
