Welp, I'm back to the blog again!

It's been about 11 months now since my last one, and a lot has changed! I've moved, gotten into disc golf (along with my fiance, pictured below), and I've gotten a new job! It's been so fun, but things have finally settled enough for me to begin writing again. 

Some additional topics that I'll be able to write about now (other then camping) is going to be Disc Golf, the Minecraft server that I administrate, and just anything else that comes to mind (cybersecurity of course as well).

This is a pretty short post for now, but I'm also going to be writing an actual article on my intro to disc golf, so watch out for that!

Anyways, subscribe on RSS to this, and I can't wait to get started with some more writing!
