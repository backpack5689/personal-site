Hi all, and welcome to my website!

There are going to be a lot of things that are going to end up on this blog, but to begin with, I'm just happy you're taking the time to read this!

First, a little bit about me! I am a Security analyst by day, and a lot of different hats by night. Wether I'm out camping, playing videogames, watching a movie with my girlfriend, or helping with church, I always end up being a bit busy.

For those of you wondering "What's gonna be here", well I'm gonna tell ya! My hope with this blog is to talk about whatever I feel like telling people about! This is going to range from sharing trips I've done recently, talking about Linux and Open Source items, or just things that I learn, wether that be Information Security, or religous.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to email me! It may end up as a post :)
