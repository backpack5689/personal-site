      <description>&amp;ldquo;The fire is the main comfort of camp, whether in summer or winter.&amp;rdquo; ~Henry David Thoreau
Camping is such an amazing time to disconnect, relax, and just hang out with those that you want to really spend time with. Because this past Monday and Tuesday was my Girlfriend&amp;rsquo;s fall break, we both decided that I would take some PTO for Monday, and we&amp;rsquo;d have a extended camping trip. Needless to say, it was well needed.</description>

      <description>Hi all, and welcome to my website!
There are going to be a lot of things that are going to end up on this blog, but to begin with, I&amp;rsquo;m just happy you&amp;rsquo;re taking the time to read this!
First, a little bit about me! I am a Security analyst by day, and a lot of different hats by night. Wether I&amp;rsquo;m out camping, playing videogames, watching a movie with my girlfriend, or helping with church, I always end up being a bit busy.</description>
